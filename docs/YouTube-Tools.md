# YouTube Tool List


Welcome to the YouTube Tools. 
This list aims to provide a overview of all useful Tools that can be used for research on YouTube. If you face problems or issues with one of the apps within the list, feel free to post an [Issue](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/issues) on our repo. It helps us to maintain this list.

[**1. Facepager**](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager)
> Windows- and MacOS-based application (no binary release for Linux), which collects public available data from JSON-based APIs.

Facepager does not require any programming skills and offers good support through a comprehensive [Wiki](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/wiki)-and-[Facebook-group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/facepagerusers/). It is an open-source tool that can easily be installed on a local computer. However, the tool is not very intuitive and an in-depth understanding of the APIs and end points is indispensable. The tool is therefore only recommended for researchers with strong knowledge of Youtube's API structure.

[**2. vosonSML**](https://github.com/vosonlab/vosonSML)
> VosonSML is an R package that provides a suite of tools for collecting and analyzing public Twitter, YouTube and Reddit data.

The big plus of vosonSML is that it is allows automated/scheduled collection of public posts and that it provides easy-to-use functions as well as a [Shiny Dashboard](https://github.com/vosonlab/VOSONDash)-to-generate-different-types-of-networks-and-text-analyses-of-the-collected-data.-However,-because-vosonSML-is-embedded-in-R,-the-automated/scheduled-collection-of-data-takes-up-hardware-(i.e.-a-running-R-session) and knowledge of the R programming language. In addition, an authenticated app is required to collect data. Hence, vosonSML is only recommended for researchers with basic R knowledge and short-term automated/scheduled collection of data.
